6) Trades draw prioritizes "paper credentials" over economic impact (Comparison: Fast Food Service vs. Critical Infrastructure Trade)
Profile A — Line Cook (A&W)
                                                            * Age: 30

                                                            * Official languages: Native English (CLB 10)

                                                            * Canadian study: Yes (2-year Canadian credential)

                                                            * Canadian work experience: 1 year — Cook

                                                            * Foreign work experience: 1 year — Overseas

                                                            * Certificate of Qualification: Yes (Cook — Red Seal available but not mandatory for role)

                                                            * Relatives in Canada: Yes (Brother)

                                                            * Verdict: The general draw CRS average in 2025 was often above 510, with Trades draws being lower. This candidate has a CRS score of 509. Despite working in a low-wage, high-turnover role, their score is inflated by "settlement points" (Canadian diploma and a sibling in Canada). They are competitively positioned for both General draws and Trades draws, having a higher likelihood of invitation than the high-earning specialist below.[a]
Profile B — Industrial Electrician (Steel Plant)
                                                               * Age: 33

                                                               * Canadian study: None

                                                               * Canadian work experience: 5 years — Industrial Electrician

                                                               * Foreign work experience: 6 years — in the UK

                                                               * Certificate of Qualification: Yes (Mandatory Red Seal — Industrial Electrician)

                                                               * Relatives in Canada: None

                                                               * Other factors: Trades-category eligible; Very high earning potential ($150,000/year); Critical infrastructure role

                                                               * CRS: 502

                                                               * Verdict: This candidate has a CRS score of 502, which is 7 points lower than the line cook. Despite contributing significantly more to the tax base ($150k salary) and holding a mandatory, high-risk technical license, they lose points solely due to being slightly older and lacking a Canadian school diploma. They would likely miss a general draw cutoff that the Line Cook might make, forcing them to rely exclusively on a specific Trades category draw.


[a]@steven@sjpimmigration.com since there were no general draws we have to focus the verdict on trades and CEC. This person would have missed CEC regardless because the lowest cutoff was 515 and they wouldn't make it. Same thing applies for the electrician. Both would only qualify through trades but line cook would have higher chances and be ranked higher. Should we update both verdicts to reflect that?
